/** @page FLASH_EraseBlockOnFlashProgramMemory Write bytes, Write words, Erase block


  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description on how to use FLASH Write byte,write word, Erase Block modes:
  - Program 32/64 (FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE/2) bytes (from flash program memory last physical address minus FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE up to
    flash program memory last physical address minus FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE/2).
  - Check programmed bytes.
  - Program 8/16 (FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE/8) words (from flash program memory last physical address minus FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE/2 up to
    flash program memory last physical address).
  - Check programmed words.
  - Erase block (64/128bytes = 1block) (from flash program memory last physical address minus FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE up to 
    flash program memory last physical address).
  - Check erase.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM8S208, STM8S207, STM8S105, STM8S103 and STM8S903 devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8/128-EVAL evaluation
    board (STM8S208) and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic compiler).
    And can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Use the linker file given in the directory (stm8sxxx.lkf)
    -> In STVD Select Project\Settings\Linker\Category "input" then unchecks the "Auto" box 
       and in the "Script Lkf file name" field add the dedicated linker file.
    - When using the STM8S208 or STM8S207 device select the stm8s208.lkf linker file
    - When using the STM8S105 device select the stm8s105.lkf linker file
    - When using the STM8S103 or STM8S903 device select the stm8s103.lkf linker file

  - Uncomment the line "#define USE_COSMIC_SECTIONS  (1)" to use the cosmic section in the stm8s.h file.	
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8s_flash.c
  - Edit stm8s.h file to select the device you are working on (#define STM8S208, in this case).
  
  @b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for more
          details please refer to "stm8s_fwlib_um.chm" user manual; select "Peripheral Examples"
          then follow the instructions provided in "How to proceed" section.   
  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - You can check the value of the bytes at the specified addresses by using the memory window in STVD.
  - The data read from the data memory is compared with the expected values.
    The result of this comparison is stored in the "OperationStatus" variable.
