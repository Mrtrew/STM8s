/** @page TIM2_OC_InactiveMode Generate three different signals with three different delays with Inactive Mode

  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate three different 
  signals with three different delays.

  The TIM2CLK frequency is set to 2 MHz, the Prescaler is set to 2048 and used in 
  Output Compare Inctive Mode.
 
  TIM2 counter clock = TIM2CLK / (Prescaler) = 976 Hz 


  The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 976:
  TIM2_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM2 counter clock  = 1000 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 1000 ms.

  The TIM2 CCR2 register value is equal to 488:
  TIM2_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 500 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.

  The TIM2 CCR3 register value is equal to 244:
  TIM2_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 250 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 250 ms.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM8S208, STM8S207, STM8S105 and STM8S103 devices.	  
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8/128-EVAL evaluation
    board (STM8S208) and ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain (Cosmic compiler).
    And can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM8/128-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope:
	    - Pin PG.5
	    - Pin PG.6
	    - Pin PG.7

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Create a project and setup all project configuration
  - Add the required Library files :
    - stm8s_tim2.c
    - stm8s_gpio.c
  - Edit stm8s.h file to select the device you are working on (#define STM8S208, in this case).
  
  @b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for more
          details please refer to "stm8s_fwlib_um.chm" user manual; select "Peripheral Examples"
          then follow the instructions provided in "How to proceed" section.   
  - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
  - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - Connect PG.5 , PG.6 and PG.7 pins to an oscilloscope
